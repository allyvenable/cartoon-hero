		<h2>How We Met</h2>
		<p>Well, we didn't have much of a choice.<br>
			You see, my mom married Jack's dad.<br>
		At first we didn't like eachother.<br>
	(Case in point)</p>

		<!-- REASONS WHY -->
		<h2>Reasons why we didn't like eachother...</h2>
		<ol>
			<li class="margin">My mom started petting Jack more than me</li>
			<li class="margin">We had to share a home</li>
			<li class="margin">Jack hated cats</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- HOW WE DID IT -->
		<h2>How we started to tolerate one another...</h2>
		<p>We started realizing our parents got sad when we fought.<br>
			We figured since it looked like we were going to be stuck under<br>  
			the same roof, it was time to make some changes.<br>
			Here are some articles that helped us make those changes:</p>

		</ul>
		<h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
		<p>After co-existing for a few months, we realized it was actually better to  not be alone all day.<br>  
		I can happily say that it's now been a healthy four years and Jack is my best friend.</p>
