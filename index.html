		<h2>How We Met</h2>
		<p>Well, we didn't have much of a choice. You see, my mom married his dad. At first we didn't like eachother.</p>
		<img src="img/5.jpg">
		<p>Jack and Dexter</p>
		<!-- REASONS WHY -->
		<h2>Reasons why we didn't like eachother...</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>My mom started petting Jack more than me</li>
			<li>We had to share a home</li>
			<li>Jack hated cats</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- HOW WE DID IT -->
		<h2>How we started to tolerate one another...</h2>
		<p>We started realizing our parents got sad when we fought. We figured since it looked like we were going to be stuck under the same roof, it was time to make some changes. Here are some articles that helped us make those changes:</p>

		</ul>
		<h2>Practive Makes Perfect</h2>
		<p>After co-existing for a few months, we realized it was actually better to  not be alone all day. I can happily say that it's now been a healthy four years and Jack is my best friend.</p>
